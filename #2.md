Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {

	s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

	// Method 1: Multiply everything, then divide
	{
		m := 1
		for _, i := range s {
			m *= i
		}
		result := make([]int, len(s))
		for pos, i := range s {
			result[pos] = m / i
		}
		fmt.Println(result)
	}

	// Method 2: Two for loop.
	{

		result := make([]int, len(s))
		for pos, _ := range s {
			for pos2, j := range s {
				if pos == pos2 {
					continue
				}
				if result[pos] == 0 {
					result[pos] = 1
				}
				result[pos] *= j
			}
		}
		fmt.Println(result)
	}
	multiple := func(nums []int) int {
		result := 1
		for _, n := range nums {
			result *= n
		}
		return result
	}

	// Method 3: Circular.
	{
		result := make([]int, len(s))
		for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {
			var hd int
			hd, s = s[0], s[1:]
			result[i] = multiple(s)
			s = append(s, hd)
		}
		fmt.Println(result)
	}
}
```
