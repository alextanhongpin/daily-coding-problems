Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## With Two for-loops
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s := []int{10, 15, 3, 7}
	k := 17
	/*
		 	For each number, try adding the next number.
			10 + 15
			10 + 3
			10 + 7
			15 + 3
			15 + 7
			3 + 7
	*/

	for pos, i := range s {
		for _, j := range s[pos+1:] {
			if k == i+j {
				fmt.Printf("%d + %d = %d", i, j, k)
			}
		}
	}
}
```


## With Hash
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s := []int{10, 15, 3, 7}
	k := 17
	set := make(map[int]bool)
	for _, i := range s {
		if v := k - i; v > 0 && set[v] {
			fmt.Printf("sum of %d and %d", i, k-i)
			break
		}
		set[i] = true
	}
}
```
